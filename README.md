# GrowSet

This is my Discord Library written in Kotlin. It was made for study purposes.

**DISCLAIMER**: Please, don't use this library for production purposes. It's not ready for that. If you want to use a good library for JVM (Kotlin/Java) use [JDA](https://github.com/discord-jda/JDA) or [Kord](https://github.com/kordlib/kord) (or both if you're [insane](https://github.com/MrPowerGamerBR)).

### Extras ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è
- This library was made in one day, it's not perfect and doesn't have all the features you may need;
- It comes with an example bot in the root `src` folder. The library is in another module;
- When doing this library, I took JDA's Gateway Events and Kord's syntax as an example.
